- password for ORDS_PUBLIC_USER

To do:
- Download jdk-11.0.17_linux-x64_bin.rpm from here https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html#license-lightbox
- place both tnsnames.ora and jdk*.rpm in the same folder ords4xe
- In the config_ords.sh file remember to change YOURPASSFORSYS and YOURPASSFORORDS_PUBLIC_USER to your own settings.
- In the tnsnames.ora file , remeber to change the YOURHOSTID

To Build:

      docker build -t ords_4_ex:1.0.0 .


To Run:

      docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ords_4_ex:1.0.0


For ATP, you need 
- JDK11
- create CUSTOM_ORDS_PUBLIC_USER, grant connect and provision_runtime_role (read here https://wordpress.chaoyu.nl/?p=810 )
- set CDN image location  (read here https://wordpress.chaoyu.nl/?p=810 )

      -- 1. Create the database user.
      create user custom_ords_public_user identified by YOURPASSWORD;
      -- 2. Allow the user to connect to the database.
      grant connect to custom_ords_public_user;
      -- 3. Perform some magic.
      begin
          ords_admin.provision_runtime_role(
              p_user => 'CUSTOM_ORDS_PUBLIC_USER'
              , p_proxy_enabled_schemas => true
          );
      end;
      /
      begin 
          apex_instance_admin.set_parameter(
              p_parameter => 'IMAGE_PREFIX',
              p_value     => 'https://static.oracle.com/cdn/apex/22.2.0/');
          commit;
        end;
      /
        
      
- ATP wallet zip file( which can be downloaded from your OCI console )  
- Change passwd in Dockerfile for ords password and atp service name( this can be found in OCI )

      RUN bash -e config_ords.sh <PWD for Custom_ords_public_user> <atp tns name>
      
Once you have wallet zip file, jdk 11 , passwd and tnsname ready, 
To build 

      docker build -t ords_4_apt:1.0.0 .
      
To Run 
      
      docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ords_4_apt:1.0.0
      
To be able to test ATP APEX builder, you do need a proxy server with ssl enabled, else you will have this error. XE APEX builder does not have this problem.
